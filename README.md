The idea of this repo is to build a simple game using the Raylib engine that can run on the raspberry pi zero. It should be a top down WASD and arrows shooter, similar to Binding of Isaac.
I would like to have a solid understanding of how the engine compiles code but the initial interest is learning simple movement and shooting. Creating sprites and animation is to come down
the line.
